## 🎮 What Is This?

This is a vibe-coding lab where students use **AI tools** like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, or Google Gemini to co-create a hilarious and simple browser game.

The game logic lives entirely in one `index.html` file — no build steps, no frameworks, just old-school fun with new-school intelligence.

## 🧠 Starter Prompt (Paste Into Your AI Assistant)
"I'm vibe-coding a funny animated browser game using a single index.html file. Help me build a game called \"Chicken Dodge!\" where:

- A chicken moves left/right with arrow keys
- Eggs fall randomly from the top of the screen
- The player dodges the eggs
- If an egg hits the chicken, it’s game over
- Score increases for every missed egg
- The game uses emojis or funny graphics
- Add simple animations, game over screen, and score tracking
- Include brief comments and make it mobile-friendly

No external libraries or separate files. Embed all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in one file."
